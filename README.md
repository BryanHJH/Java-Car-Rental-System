# Java Car Rental System

## Introduction

This repository will be used for developing the Car Rental System for our OOD with Java module

## Current Idea of the Flow

1. A Dealership class will contain a list of Dealers (the workers) and a list of cars that can be rented.
2. Cars have more than one type, like 6 seaters, sedans, SUVs, etc. We will create a class for each of this (at least 3) and make them inherit from the Car class
3. Dealers will be separated into normal Dealers and admin Dealers, where admin Dealers can edit Car information and read Reports generated by the Dealership class.
4. Customers will need to enter basic personal information when they first register and can edit these information after registration.
5. Customers will first book the car that they want to rent by browsing through the catalog. The catalog will only show Cars that can be booked.
6. Dealers will need to approve the booking in order for the customer to collect the car in the appointed date. Once approved, the customer will receive a notification (either via email or text message) about the approval or rejection.
7. When customers return the rented car, the dealer will also need to approve the return. If approved, a notification is sent only. If rejected, a notification is sent and a fine is imposed on the customer.
